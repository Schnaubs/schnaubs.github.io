    <p>Exploring the Aztec, Inca, and Maya Civilizations</p>
  </header>

  <section id="aztecs">
    <h2>Aztecs</h2>
    <h3>Tenochtitlan</h3>
    <center><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/11/Templo_Mayor_in_Mexico-Tenochtitlan_16th_century_%28illustration_1900%29.jpg"/></center>
    <p><strong>Significance:</strong> Tenochtitlan, the capital of the Aztec Empire, was built on an island in Lake Texcoco. It amazed Spanish conquistadors with its size, advanced architecture, and clean streets. It symbolized the height of Aztec engineering and urban planning.</p>


    <h3>Conquering Peoples</h3>
    <p>The Aztecs expanded their empire through military conquest and a tribute system. Defeated peoples had to pay goods, crops, or labor, enriching the Aztec capital and supporting its temples and armies.</p>

    <h3>Chinampas</h3>
    <center><img src="https://midwestpermaculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/chinampasImage.jpg" alt="Aztec Chinampas in Xochimilco"/></center>
    <p>Chinampas, or floating gardens, were man-made agricultural islands used to grow crops on shallow lake beds. They allowed year-round farming and supported a large urban population.</p>

    <h3>Imperialism</h3>
    <p>The Aztec Empire is a strong example of imperialism. It dominated surrounding regions politically and economically, extracting tribute and imposing cultural and religious practices on conquered peoples.</p>
  </section>

  <section id="incas">
    <h2>Incas</h2>
    <h3>Cusco</h3>
    <center><img src="https://e5rxtr4t5ah.exactdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/cusco-things-to-do-header.jpg?strip=all&lossy=1&ssl=1"/></center>
    <p><strong>Significance:</strong> Cusco was the heart of the Inca Empire, symbolizing political, religious, and cultural unity. Its layout was designed to resemble a puma, an animal sacred to the Incas.</p>

    <h3>Terracing & Waru Waru</h3>
    <center><img src="https://images.nationalgeographic.org/image/upload/v1638892366/EducationHub/photos/terraces-at-pisac.jpg"/></center>
    <p>The Incas invented <strong>terracing</strong> and <strong>Waru Waru</strong> agriculture to adapt to the Andes’ rugged terrain. These techniques prevented erosion, conserved water, and created microclimates for growing crops.</p>

    <h3>M’ita</h3>
    <p>The M’ita was a labor tax system requiring citizens to contribute work to public projects, such as roads and temples. This system allowed the Incas to maintain infrastructure across their vast empire.</p>

    <h3>Machu Picchu</h3>
    <center><img src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WFJBpzs4J5x3uvbeKdnm3i.jpg" alt="Machu Picchu"/></center>
    <p><strong>Significance:</strong> Machu Picchu was a royal estate and spiritual site. Hidden in the Andes, it remained unknown to Europeans until 1911 when it was rediscovered by Hiram Bingham.</p>
  </section>

  <section id="maya">
    <h2>Maya</h2>
    <h3>“Greeks of the New World”</h3>
    <p>The Maya are called the “Greeks of the New World” for their intellectual achievements, complex writing, and advanced mathematics and astronomy.</p>

    <h3>Accomplishments</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Developed one of the world’s first written scripts.</li>
      <li>Accurate calendar system based on astronomy.</li>
      <li>Created impressive architecture such as pyramids and observatories.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Map / Location</h3>
    <center><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ef/Maya_civilization_location_map_-_geography.svg" alt="Map of Maya Civilization"/></center>

    <h3>City-States</h3>
    <p>The Maya were organized into independent city-states, much like ancient Greece. Each city had its own ruler and political system, leading to both cooperation and conflict.</p>
